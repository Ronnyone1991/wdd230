        Caracas is the capital and the most populated city of Venezuela. Since
        the 19th century, it has been considered the center of political and
        economic power in Venezuela. It is located in the north-central coastal
        area of ​​the country, 12 km from the coast of the Caribbean Sea and is
        located within a mountainous valley. Although it is located near the
        coast, the city is located at almost 900 meters of altitude , separated
        from the central coast of Vargas, by the Cordillera de la Costa and
        which, as it passes through the urban nucleus, is constituted as the El
        Ávila National Park. The Caracas-La Guaira highway, serves as the main
        communication route between the city ​​and the coastal state of La
        Guaira, as well as the Simón Bolívar de Maiquetía International Airport
        and the port of La Guaira, the second port in the country.
